# Contributing

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Keep changes focused and small; one improvement per pull request.
3. Follow existing conventions in `commands/` and `templates/`.
4. Add or update tests when applicable.
5. Ensure the plugin still loads in Claude Code with `--plugin-dir`.

## Best practices

- Prefer clear, explicit instructions over clever shortcuts.
- Avoid Gemini-specific behavior unless it has a Claude Code equivalent.
- Keep prompts deterministic and easy to audit.
- Document any behavior changes in the pull request description.

## Reporting issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, open an issue with:

- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce
- Environment details (OS, Claude Code version)

Thank you for helping improve Conductor.
