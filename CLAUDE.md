# Conductor Context

If a user mentions a "plan" or asks about the plan, and they have used the conductor extension in the current session, they are likely referring to the `conductor/tracks.md` file or one of the track plans (`conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md`).

## Available Commands

- `/conductor:setup` - Initialize the Conductor environment for your project
- `/conductor:new-track` - Create a new feature/bug track with spec and plan
- `/conductor:implement` - Execute tasks from a track's plan
- `/conductor:status` - Display current project progress
- `/conductor:revert` - Git-aware revert of tracks, phases, or tasks
